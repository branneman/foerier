 * folded state, selectors and UI props are ordinary TypeScript. The reducer is
 * the one place the two meet (architecture §12).
 *
 * Every field is a {@link Register} — a value plus the `(hlc, device_id)` of
 * the op that last wrote it — because the merge unit is the field, not the
 * record. Every field is **optional**, and with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
 * that means the key is absent rather than holding `undefined`: an absent
 * register was never addressed by any op, which is a different fact from a
 * register holding `null`.
